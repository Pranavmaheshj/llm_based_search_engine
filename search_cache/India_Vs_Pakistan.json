A long-runningdispute over Kashmirandcross-border terrorismhave been the predominant cause of conflict between the two states, with the exception of theIndo-Pakistani War of 1971, which occurred as a direct result of hostilities stemming from theBangladesh Liberation Warin erstwhileEast Pakistan(nowBangladesh). ThePartition of Indiacame in 1947 with the sudden grant of independence.[8]It was the intention of those who wished for a Muslim state to have a clean partition between independent and equal \"Pakistan\" and \"Hindustan\" once independence came.[9] Nearly one third of the Muslim population of India remained in the new India.[10][11][12] Inter-communal violence between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims resulted in between 200,000 and 2 million casualties leaving 14 million people displaced.[8][13][a][14] Princely statesin India were provided with anInstrument of Accessionto accede to either India or Pakistan.[15] The war, also called theFirst India\u2013Pakistan War, started in October 1947 when Pakistan feared that theMaharajaof theprincely stateofKashmir and Jammuwould accede to India. Following partition,princely stateswere left to choose whether to join India or Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a majority Muslim population and significant fraction of Hindu population, all ruled by the HinduMaharajaHari Singh. Tribal Islamic forces with support from the army of Pakistan attacked and occupied parts of the princely state forcing the Maharaja to sign theInstrument of Accessionof the princely state to theDominion of Indiato receive Indian military aid. The UN Security Council passedResolution 47on 22 April 1948. The fronts solidified gradually along what came to be known as theLine of Control. A formal cease-fire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 1 January 1949.[16]:\u200a379India gained control of about two-thirds of the state (Kashmir Valley,JammuandLadakh) whereas Pakistan gained roughly a third ofKashmir (Azad Kashmir, andGilgit-Baltistan).The Pakistan controlled areas are collectively referred to as Pakistan administered Kashmir.[17][18][19][20] This war started following Pakistan'sOperation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces intoJammu and Kashmirto precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack onWest Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II.[21][22]The hostilities between the two countries ended after a ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and USA and the subsequent issuance of theTashkent Declaration.[23]India had the upper hand over Pakistan when the ceasefire was declared.[24][25][26][27] This war was unique in the way that it did not involve the issue of Kashmir, but was rather precipitated by the crisis created by the political battle brewing in erstwhileEast Pakistan(nowBangladesh) betweenSheikh Mujibur Rahman, Leader ofEast Pakistan, andYahya KhanandZulfikar Ali Bhutto, leaders of West Pakistan. This would culminate in the declaration of Independence ofBangladeshfrom the state system of Pakistan. FollowingOperation Searchlightand the1971 Bangladesh atrocities, about 10 million Bengalis in East Pakistan took refuge in neighbouring India.[29]India intervened in the ongoingBangladesh liberation movement.[30][31]After a large scalepre-emptive strikeby Pakistan, full-scale hostilities between the two countries commenced. Pakistan attacked at several places along India's western border with Pakistan, but theIndian Armysuccessfully held their positions. The Indian Army quickly responded to the Pakistan Army's movements in the west and made some initial gains, including capturing around 15,010 square kilometres (5,795 square miles)[32][33][34]of Pakistani territory (land gained by India in Pakistani Kashmir,Pakistani PunjabandSindhsectors but gifted it back to Pakistan in theSimla Agreementof 1972, as a gesture of goodwill). Within two weeks of intense fighting, Pakistani forces inEast Pakistansurrenderedto the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces following which thePeople's Republic of Bangladeshwas created.[35]The war   resulted in the surrender of more than 90,000 Pakistani Army troops.[36]In the words of one Pakistani author, \"Pakistan lost half its navy, a quarter of its air force and a third of its army\".[37] This conflict between the two countries was mostly limited. During early 1999, Pakistani troops infiltrated across theLine of Control(LoC) and occupied Indian territory mostly in theKargil district. India responded by launching a major military and diplomatic offensive to drive out the Pakistani infiltrators.[38]Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges that were encroached by the infiltrators.[39][40]According to official count, an estimated 75%\u201380% of the intruded area and nearly all high ground was back under Indian control.[41]Fearing large-scale escalation in military conflict, the international community, led by theUnited States, increased diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to withdraw forces from remaining Indian territory.[38][42]Faced with the possibility of international isolation, the already fragilePakistani economywas weakened further.[43][44]The morale of Pakistani forces after the withdrawal declined as many units of theNorthern Light Infantrysuffered heavy casualties.[45][46]The government refused to accept the dead bodies of many officers,[47][48]an issue that provoked outrage and protests in the Northern Areas.[49][50]Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its casualties, butNawaz Shariflater said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation and that Pakistan had lost the conflict.[51][52]By the end of July 1999, organized hostilities in the Kargil district had ceased.[42]The war was a major military defeat for the Pakistani Army.[53][54] Apart from the aforementioned wars, there have been other regional conflicts between the two nations from time to time, which have not bordered on all-out war.[23] TheSiachen conflict, sometimes referred to as theSiachen Glacier conflictor theSiachen War, was a military conflict between India and Pakistan over the disputed 1,000-square-mile (2,600\u00a0km2)[55]Siachen Glacierregion inKashmir.[23][56]The conflict was started in 1984 by India's successful capture of the Siachen Glacier as part ofOperation Meghdoot, and continued withOperation Rajivin 1987. India took control of the 70-kilometre-long (43\u00a0mi) Siachen Glacier and its tributary glaciers, as well as all the main passes and heights of theSaltoro Ridgeimmediately west of the glacier, includingSia La,Bilafond La, andGyong La. Pakistan controls the glacial valleys immediately west of the Saltoro Ridge.[57][58][page\u00a0needed]A cease-fire went into effect in 2003,[59]but both sides maintain a heavy military presence in the area. The2025India\u2013Pakistan conflictwas a brief armed conflict betweenIndiaandPakistanthat began on 7 May 2025, after India launched missile strikes on Pakistan, codenamedOperation Sindoor.[b]India stated that the operation was a response to thePahalgam attackon 22 April by militants in the Indian administered Kashmir killing 26 civilians, mostly tourists. The attack intensifiedtensions between India and Pakistanas India accused Pakistan of supportingcross-border terrorism, which Pakistan denied. According to India, the missile strikes of Operation Sindoor targeted the camps and infrastructure of militant groupsJaish-e-MohammedandLashkar-e-Taiba, and no Pakistani military facilities were targeted. According to Pakistan, the Indian strikes targeted civilian areas, including mosques, killing 31 Pakistani civilians. Following these strikes, border skirmshes and drone strikes occurred between the two countries. On 10 May, Pakistan launched an operation codenamedOperation Bunyan al-Marsus,[c]targeting several Indian military bases.[63]In retaliation, India also continued Operation Sindoor, expanding its scope to target Pakistani military installations.[64]This conflict marked the first drone battle between the two nuclear-armed nations. After three days of the conflict, both India and Pakistan announced that a ceasefire was agreed, effective from 5:00\u00a0pmIST/04:30\u00a0pmPKT(11:30UTC) on 10 May, with talks set for 12 May. Following the deadline, both countries accused each other of violating the ceasefire agreement. Alongside full-scale wars and conflicts, several notable military skirmishes, border incidents, and standoffs have occurred between India and Pakistan, further straining bilateral relations and drawing international attention. Thenuclear conflictbetween both countries is of passive strategic nature withnuclear doctrine of Pakistanstating afirst strikepolicy, although the strike would only be initiated if and only if, the Pakistan Armed Forces are unable to halt an invasion (as for example in1971 war) or a nuclear strike is launched against Pakistan,[citation needed]whereas India has a declaredpolicyofno first use. According to a peer"}, {"url": "https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan", "title": "Conflict Between India and Pakistan | Global Conflict Tracker", "content": "Conflict Between India and Pakistan Sign Up for Our Newsletter Back to Map Center for Preventive Action A deadly militant attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, has triggered asharp escalationbetween India and Pakistan, with both sides exchanging gunfire across the Line of Control and downgrading diplomatic ties. On May 6, India announced the launch of \"Operation Sindoor,\" a military striketargeting nine sitesin Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Jammu and Kashmir, which it alleged were used to plan the attacks. The situation has heightened fears of a broader military conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations, marking the most significant bilateral confrontation since 2019. The conflict between India and Pakistan arose out of the 1947Partitionof British India. The Partition established a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a Hindu-majority India and provided the diverse regions of Jammu and Kashmir the opportunity to choose which country toaccedeto. Themaharaja(Kashmir\u2019s monarch) initially soughtindependence, as Kashmir wasneglectedand subjugated for centuries by conquering empires. However, he ultimately agreed to join India in exchange for help against invading Pakistani herders, triggering the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48. The Karachi Agreement of 1949 temporarily ended violence in the Jammu-Kashmir region by establishing a cease-fire line (CFL)overseenby members of a UN truce subcommittee. Tensions simmered until a skirmish between border controlsescalatedto a full-blown war in 1965. In 1971, India and Pakistan fought anotherbrief warover East Pakistan, with Indian forces helping the territory gain independence, resulting in the establishment of present-day Bangladesh. India and Pakistan attempted to usher in a new era of bilateral relations with the1972 Simla Agreement, which established theLine of Control(LOC). This provisional military control line split Kashmir into two administrative regions. However, in 1974, the conflict took on a new dimension with the introduction ofnuclear weapons, raising the stakes of any confrontation. That year, Indiatestedits first nuclear weapon, triggering a nuclear arms race that would see Pakistan reach that same milestone two decades later. In 1989, Pakistancapitalizedupon a burgeoning resistance movement in Indian-administered Kashmir to undermine Indian control, reigniting tensions and beginning decades ofcommunal violence. Despite a recommitment to the LOC in 1999, Pakistani soldiers crossed the LOC, sparking theKargil War. Although both countries have maintained a fragilecease-firesince 2003, they regularly exchange fire across the contested border. Both sides accuse the other of violating the cease-fire and claim to be shooting in response to attacks. On November 26, 2008, fears that India and Pakistan would once again head towards direct military confrontation rose after militants laid siege to the Indian capital of Mumbai. Over three days, 166 peoplewere killed, including 6 Americans. Both India and the United Statesblamedthe Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a militant group with alleged ties to the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)\u2014Pakistan\u2019s primary intelligence agency\u2014for perpetrating the attack. The Indian governmentcooperatedwith the Pakistani government to bring the perpetrators to justice, paving the way for improved relations. In 2014, many hoped India would pursue meaningful peace negotiations with Pakistan after India\u2019s newly elected Prime Minister, Narendra Modi,invitedPakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to attend his inauguration. After a brief period of optimism, relations soured in August 2014 when Indiacanceledtalks with Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister after the Pakistani high commissioner in India met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. Momentum toward meaningful talks halted in September 2016, when armed militantsattackeda remote Indian Army base in Uri, near the LOC, killing eighteen Indian soldiers in the deadliest attack on the Indian armed forces in decades. Indian officialsaccusedJaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), another group with alleged ties to ISI, of conducting the attack. In response, the Indian militaryannouncedit had carried out \u201csurgical strikes\u201d on terrorist camps inside Pakistani-administered Kashmir. In contrast, the Pakistani military denied that any such operation had taken place. This period was marked by an uptick in border skirmishes that began in late 2016 and continued into 2018,killingdozens anddisplacingthousands of civilians on both sides of the Line of Control. More than three thousand cross-border strikes were reported in 2017, while nearly one thousand were reported in the first half of 2018. Militants launched attacks in October 2017 against anIndian paramilitary campnear Srinagar and, in February 2018, against anIndian army basein the Jammu region, which killed five soldiers and a civilian. During this time, violent demonstrations and anti-Indiaprotestscalling for an independent Kashmir alsocontinued. Over three hundred people, including civilians, Indian security forces, and militants, were killed in attacks and clashes in 2017. After months of Indian military operations targeting both Kashmiri militants and demonstrations, Indiaannouncedin May 2018 that it would observe a cease-fire in Kashmir during the month of Ramadan for the first time in nearly two decades; operationsresumedin June 2018. Later in May, India and Pakistan formally agreed to acease-firealong the disputed Kashmir border that would restore the terms of their2003 agreement. In February 2019, an\u00a0attack on a convoy of Indian paramilitary forces in Pulwama, Indian-administered Kashmir, killed at least forty soldiers. The attack, claimed by the Pakistani militant group JeM, was thedeadliest in Kashmirin three decades. India retaliated with anair striketargeting terrorist training camps within Pakistani territory, which was followed by Pakistani air strikes on Indian-administered Kashmir. The exchange escalated into anaerial engagement, during which Pakistan shot down two Indian military aircraft and captured an Indian pilot; the pilot wasreleasedtwo days later. In August 2019, following adeploymentof tens of thousands of additional troops and paramilitary forces to the region, the Indian government moved torevoke Article 370of the Indian constitution. The change removed Jammu and Kashmir\u2019sspecial status, forcing Kashmiris to abide by Indian property and customary law and effectively diminishing their autonomy. The ruling not only angered Kashmiris but was also viewed as a \u201cgrave injustice\u201d by Pakistan. The removal of Article 370 signified the more aggressive approach of the Modi government to integrate Kashmir into India through a doctrine ofHindu nationalism. Following the revocation of Article 370, India-administered Kashmir remained underlockdownfor over a year, with internet and phone services intermittently cut off andthousands of peopledetained. In 2022 and 2023, the Indian central governmentcracked downon independent media in the region,redrewthe electoral map to privilege Hindu-majority areas in Kashmir, and held aG20 tourism meetingin Srinagar. Targeted killingsagainst Hindus have become more frequent, motivating some to flee and protest government policies. In response to the uptick in violence, the Modi government has taken an increasinglymilitarized response.\u00a0 Deadly clashes between Indian and Pakistani forces alsopersistedin 2023. Throughout 2024, violence continued in Kashmir in response to increasing efforts by New Delhi to consolidate territorial control. Attacks specifically targeted Indian travelers and workers in the region. In June 2024, militantsopened fire on a buscarrying pilgrims traveling to a Hindu shrine in the town of Reasi. The attack killed nine and injured over thirty. In October, militantskilled\u00a0sevenin Kashmir at a construction site for atunnel projectconnecting Kashmir to the northern region of Ladakh. On April 22, 2025, tensions escalated after militants attacked Indian tourists in Kashmir, killing twenty-five Indian nationals and one Nepalese national. The incident marked the deadliest terrorist attack in Indian territory since the 2008 Mumbai attacks. India blamed Pakistan for harboring the group responsible for the attack and arrested two Pakistani nationals as suspects. Pakistandeniedany involvement, and its defense ministry evensuggestedthe attack was a\u00a0\u201cfalse flag operation.\u201d Although no group has been officially identified as responsible for the attack, the Kashmir Resistance\u2014an offshoot of LeT\u2014claimed responsibility online. In the wake of the attack, tit-for-tat measures by India and Pakistan have driven bilateral relations to their lowest point in recent years. New Delhi firsttook measuresto downgrade ties with Pakistan, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, terminating a visa-free travel regime with Pakistan, and closing the Attari border crossing between the two countries. In turn, Pakistanrejectedthe suspension of the water treaty, warning that any attempts to alter Pakistan\u2019s Indus River flows would be considered \u201can act of war.\u201d Islamabadalso movedto close Pakistani airspace to all Indian commercial airlines, halted a special visa regime for Indian citizens, and suspended bilateral trade. Indian and Pakistani forces haveexchanged fireacross the LOC every day since the attack. The United States and China have called for de-escalation, with Beijing advocating for an independent investigation into the attack and its suspects. Islamabad and New Delhi have since traded military threats, with India\u2019s navytestinglong-range missiles. On April 28, Pakistan\u2019s defense ministryexpressed beliefthat an Indian military attack on Pakistani territory was \u201cimminent\u201d and that the Pakistan military was preparing reinforcements. Meanwhile, India haslaunched a crackdownin Kashmir, as Indian security forces have arrested over 1,500 Kashmiris and demolished homes of suspected militants."}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/asia/india-pakistan-us-ceasefire-no-winners-intl-hnk", "title": "Analysis: India and Pakistan both claim victory after US-brokered ... - CNN", "content": "India and Pakistan both claim victory. But this latest conflict has no winners CNN values your feedback Follow: Victory has a thousand fathers, as they say, but defeat is an orphan. And so it goes after the brief but bruising conflict between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan with both sides loudly talking up their successes while quietly down-playing losses. On India\u2019s frantic television news channels, minutes after aUS-brokered ceasefirecame into force, the headline \u201cPakistan Surrenders\u201d was splashed across the screens. India\u2019s military action against Pakistan, sparked by the killing of tourists in India-administered Kashmir last month, sent a bold message to terrorists, India\u2019s defense minister, Rajnath Singh, said later. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, crowds gathered in the streets of the capital to celebrate what Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described as \u201cmilitary history\u201d achieved by \u201cour brave army in a spectacular fashion.\u201d \u201cIn a few hours our jets silenced India\u2019s guns in a way that history will not soon forget,\u201d Sharif said, while an effigy of his Indian counterpart burned outside. But this was an eruption of violence between two nuclear-armed neighbors in which both sides delivered and suffered heavy blows. Pakistan has trumpeted successes in the skies, claiming its pilots shot down five Indian fighter jets in aerial battles \u2013 including three advanced French-made Rafales \u2013 in what would be a stinging humiliation for the Indian air force. As CNN earlier reported, two planes crashed in Indian states that border Pakistan around the time Pakistan claimed to have shot down the jets, and a French intelligence source told CNN that Pakistan had downed at least one Indian Rafale. But Indian officials are still refusing to acknowledge even a single aircraft loss. Meanwhile, India has released new satellite images showing serious damage to air strips and radar stations at what Indian defense officials say are multiple Pakistani military bases crippled by massive Indian airstrikes. In other words, political and military leaders in India and Pakistan can spin it how they like, but there isno clear winnerin this conflict. There\u2019s even a struggle to take credit for what were clearly US-brokered negotiations that led to the ceasefire, announced almost out of the blue by US President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform. Amid a rapidly deteriorating security situation at the weekend, which threatened to spin out of control, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he and Vice President JD Vance called political and military leaders on both sides urging them to hold back. Pakistani officials expressed gratitude for the intervention. But Indian leaders are playing down any US role, saying the truce was worked out between India and Pakistan directly. The reason is likely to be driven by national pride, with Indian officials loathe to admit a truce was imposed on them, or even brokered, by the United States. India also has a long-standing policy of refusing to allow foreign mediation when it comes to the status of Muslim-majority Kashmir - a disputed region claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety - which has been at the center of the latest conflict with Pakistan and which India regards as a strictly internal matter. Nevertheless, perhaps buoyed by his quick ceasefire win, President Trump has offered to help the two countries find a lasting solution \u201cafter a thousand years\u201d concerning Kashmir. Inevitably, Pakistan has welcomed the idea, while in India it has fallen on deaf ears. The offer is a stark reminder, though, that the US-brokered truce is little more than a quick fix, a band aid that is unlikely to remotely address the fundamental grievances fueling what is actually a decades long dispute, over the status of Kashmir. And if you think the Indian and Pakistani claims of victory both ring a bit hollow now, just wait until the simmering Kashmir dispute, inevitably, boils over once again."}, {"url": "https://www.bcci.tv/video/5566068/india-vs-pakistan--icc-champions-trophy-2025---match-highlights", "title": "India vs Pakistan | ICC Champions Trophy, 2025 - Match Highlights - BCCI", "content": "Copyrights BCCI 2025, All Rights Reserved.

On 7 May 2025, India launched missile strikes in Pakistan, leading to amilitary conflictbetween the two countries. A ceasefire was announced on 10 May 2025 following an agreement between India and Pakistan.[12] The crisis emerged between the two countries after the Pahalgam terrorist attack, as India accused Pakistan of sponsoring the militants, though Pakistan denied its involvement. India initiated with the expulsion of Pakistani diplomats, recalling its diplomatic staff, suspending visa services, and suspending theIndus Waters Treaty,[1]. Pakistan suggested an international inquiry into the terrorist attack, which India rejected.[13]Pakistan initially responded with trade restrictions, closure of airspace and border crossings, and suspension of theShimla Agreement.[4]Between 24 April and 6 May, Pakistan and India engaged in skirmishes including cross-border firing and intermittent artillery shelling.[14] On 7 May 2025, India launched missile strikes on Pakistan, codenamedOperation Sindoor. According to India, the missile strikes targeted the militant groupsJaish-e-MohammedandLashkar-e-Taiba. According to Pakistan, the Indian strikes targeted civilian areas, including mosques, killing 31 Pakistani civilians. In return, Pakistan said they had downed a number of Indian jets and damaged Indian infrastructure. The military hostilities continued until a ceasefire was reached on 10 May 2025.[15] AnIslamist armed insurgencybroke out inJammu and Kashmirin the late 1980s, which resulted in theexodus of Kashmiri Hindusfrom the region and the insurgency has been ongoing since.[16] On 22 April 2025, aterrorist[17][18][19]attack at Baisaran Valley nearPahalgamin theAnantnag districtof Indian-administeredJammu and Kashmirkilled at least 26 tourists and injured more than 20 others.[20][21]According to eyewitness testimonies provided to Indian media outlets, assailants reportedly questioned potential victims about their religious identity before opening fire, specifically targeting non-Muslims.[22] The attack became among the deadliest attacks against Indian civilians in the region since 2000.The Resistance Front(TRF), believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistan-based,UN-designated terrorist groupLashkar-e-Taiba,[11][23][10]initially claimed responsibility. They stated that the attack was in opposition toIndian government policyallowing Indian citizens to live and work in Kashmir, that resulted in non-local settlement in the region.[24][23]Four days later, they retracted their claim.[25] On the night of 23 April 2025, the Indianforeign secretaryVikram Misriheld a special press briefing after a meeting with theCCS. He announced India's decision to temporarily suspend theIndus Waters Treatywith Pakistan with immediate effect until Pakistan ceases its support for cross-border terrorism.[26]He further announced the closure of the integrated check post atAttari\u2013WagahBorder, a travel ban for all Pakistani nationals to India under theSAARC Visa Exemption Scheme, and cancellation of all previously issued visas. Additionally, Pakistani military advisers at thePakistan High Commission in New Delhiwere expelled, while their Indian counterparts inIslamabadwere withdrawn, and the staff strength of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad was reduced from 55 to a minimum of 30. The posts of such military advisors were deemed abolished.[27][28] Pakistan's Foreign Ministryexpressed condolences to the families of the victims,[29]and its defense ministerKhawaja Asifdismissed the allegations of his country's involvement in the attack and regarded such events as revolutions.[30][31]However, in an interview withSky News, while responding to allegations of terrorism, Asif said that Pakistan had backed terrorist activities at the direction ofUnited States,Britainand theWestgoing back three decades.[32][33] Pakistan responded to the suspension of the treaty by describing it as inappropriate and lacking seriousness.[34]Pakistan also warned India of a comprehensive retaliation in response to the actions announced by the Indian government in the aftermath of the incident,[35]further stating that any action affecting water resources would be considered an act of war.[36][37]On 24 April, Pakistan suspended visas issued to Indian nationals and closed its airspace to Indian aircraft, expelled Indian diplomats and instructed Indian military advisers to depart the country no later than the 30 April.[38]However, theKartarpur Corridorremained open for Sikh pilgrims.[39]Pakistan also cut off all trade with India.[40]Pakistan also suspended theSimla Agreement, on 24 April 2025 in retaliation.[41][42]TheAttari\u2013Wagah border ceremonywas also reduced and the symbolic handshake did not take place.[43][44]Cross-border families were affected where their visas revoked.[45][46][47][48][49] A jointcordon and searchoperation was initiated by theIndian Army,paramilitary forces, andJammu and Kashmir Police. A temporary lockdown was imposed in Pahalgam, andIndian Armyhelicopters were deployed to track down the militants, who reportedly fled to the upper reaches of thePir Panjal range.[50][51]On 25 April, soldiers demolished the family residences of two individuals suspected of involvement in the Pahalgam attack.[22]An Indian soldier was killed and two other soldiers wounded during a gunfight withinsurgentsin the Basantgarh region ofUdhampur.[52]SeniorLashkar-e-TaibaCommander Altaf Lalli was also killed in the gunfight.[53] Both Pakistani and Indian air forces conducted intensive flights near the LoC.[54]An IndianBorder Security Forcesoldier belonging to the 182nd battalion of the BSF was captured byPakistan Rangersafter he accidentally entered the Pakistani side of theFerozepurborder.[55][56][57] Also on 24 April, theIndian XV Corpsreported that it had thwarted an infiltration attempt by insurgents nearUriand killed 2 insurgents.[58] Between 24 April and 5 May, Indian and Pakistani army engaged in skirmishes and exchanged small arms firing.[22][59][60][14][61]Reportedly, Pakistan's army initiatedsmall armsfiring across various sectors along the LoC,[62]which was described as \"unprovoked\" by Indian media.[63][64][65]The Pakistani army stated it shot down two Indian military quadcopter drones along the LoC in the Satwal sector and in theManawarsector ofBhimberdistrict.[66][67][68][69] On 28 April, Pakistani Defense Minister Asif stated that an attack from the Indian armed forces was \"imminent\".[70]On 30 April, Pakistan claimed it has \"credible intelligence\" that India is going to launch military action within several hours.[71]On the night of 29 April, Pakistani forces opened fire on theinternational borderalong Kashmir.[72][73]On 1 May, IndianHome MinisterAmit Shahsaid that no terrorist involved in the attack would be spared by India.[74] On 3 May, a soldier from thePakistan Rangerswas captured byBSFafter crossing the border to India.[75] On 5 May, the IndianMinistry of Home Affairsannounced an \"effective civil defence in the event of a hostile attack\" on 7 May across 7states. Such drills were last conducted by India during1971. As per reports, the drill includes operationalisation of Air Raid Warning Sirens, crash blackout measures, training of civilians on civil defence and evacuation plans.[76][77] Following the suspension of theIndus Waters Treaty of 1960on 23 April 2025, local media in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, reported on 26 and 27 April that India had released water from the Uri Dam into the Jhelum River unannounced, resulting in flooding.[78][79]Additional reports indicated a sharp decline in water levels of theChenab RiverinSialkot, Pakistan, with satellite imagery showing significant drying of the riverbed.[80]On 4 May 2025, India had closed the Baglihar Dam on the Chenab River and was planning a similar move at the Kishanganga Dam on the Neelum River.[81][82] On the night of 6/7 May, India launched \"Operation Sindoor\", striking what it described as \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistan.[83]The operation lasted 23 minutes and consisted of missile strikes byIAFjets.Rajnath Singh,Minister of Defence (India), said on 8 May that at least 100 militants had been killed in the strikes.[84] According to India, the missile strikes of Operation Sindoor targeted the camps and infrastructure of militant groupsJaish-e-MohammedandLashkar-e-Taiba, and no Pakistani military facilities were targeted.
