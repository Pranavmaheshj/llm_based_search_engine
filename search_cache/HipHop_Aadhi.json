The duo consists of Rangadhithya \"Adhi\" Ramachandran Venkatapathy and R. Jeeva.[a] Their commercial break-through came with the song \"Club le Mabbu le\" in 2011. In 2012, Hiphop Tamizha released their debut albumHip Hop Tamizhan, which is India's first Tamil hip hop album. It was a major success with both the general public and critics. While the duo were originallyindependent musicians, since 2013 they have contributed primarily to composing for films. Rangadhithya \"Adhi\" Ramachandran Venkatapathy  was born on 20 February 1990,[5][2][6]and R. Jeeva was born 29 June 1991. Adhi's father works atBharathiar Universitywhile his mother comes from an agricultural background.[3]Adhi's first exposure torapcame when his neighbour showed himMichael Jackson's \"Jam\".[7]His interest in hip hop music started developing in the tenth grade. He uploaded rap songs to the internet and got positive responses from people expressing interest in his music, who also encouraged him to start rapping in Tamil.[8]His decision to rap in Tamil rather than English was made, in his words, to avoid looking like a \"wannabe\".[7]Adhi named his account on the video-sharing site inYouTubeas \"Hiphop Tamizha\", with a profile picture of the Tamil poetSubramania Bharati, to avoid being caught by his parents.[9]Adhi's father had initially opposed his choice to pursue music professionally. He wanted Adhi to pursue higher studies, but gave him a year to do what he wanted, with the only constraint being that Adhi should not expect any help from him. After realising that Adhi was \"trying to do some good work\", he encouraged his son's musical interests.[9]Adhi then moved toChennaito \"try [his] luck\".[10] Although Hiphop is a duo,[4]Jeeva has seldom made public appearances, thus associating the nameHiphop Tamizhawith Adhi more often. Adhi toldIndiaGlitzthat this is due to his shyness, and compared his partner to the unseen lion in theemblem of India, which includes four lions, with only three visible.[11]Jeeva adopted the moniker Jeeva Beatz sometime after the two met in 2005.[1][9] Adhi studied at Chavara Vidya Bhavan andElectrical EngineeringatBannari Amman Institute of Technology. He holds a state-level rank inTamil Nadu Common Entrance Testand is a graduate inMaster of Business Administrationfrom the Department of Management Studies,University of Madras. As of October 2014, he was doing aPhDcourse at Bharathiar University,[9]which he completed in June 2015.[12]In August 2023, Adhi obtained a doctorate in Music Entrepreneurship.[13]Jeeva is an alumnus ofLoyola College, Chennai.[14] On 30 November 2017, Adhi married Latchaya in a private ceremony atTirupati.[15][16] Adhi and Jeeva met viaOrkutin 2005. They were passionate about music and decided that they should create an independent music group in India, in Tamil.[9]According toThe Hinduand Hiphop Tamizha'sFacebookpage, Adhi had not officially founded Hiphop Tamizha until 15 February 2010.[1] Around the mid-2000s, Adhi releasedViswaroobam Arambam,[1]the first Tamil hip hopmixtapein India.[b]It also played a major role in promoting hip hop as a part of the Tamil culture.[8]Adhi and Jeeva remainedundergrounduntil they were asked by theTamil Nadu State Election Commissionto compose an election anthem.[17]Hiphop Tamizha's singleEzhuvoam Vaawas chosen as the official anthem for Tamil Nadu's2011 state elections,[18]and Adhi performed it atPachaiyappa's CollegewhenAnna Hazarecame there.[17]Though the song was commercially unsuccessful,[19]Adhi and Jeeva considered it at one point their \"best work so far\".[20] Adhi composed the song \"Club le Mabbu le\" in his first year of college.[17]When we asked how it developed, he recalled, \"I grew up watching my mother and aunts just being traditional, and when I saw girls going to bars, I immediately wrote the lyrics of that track. And through my lyrics I am raising the debate over whether we are really changing as a society or are simply aping the West.\"[21]When Adhi was living in Chennai, he metMa Ka Pa Anand, then an RJ atRadio Mirchi.[10]Anand allowed Adhi to performClub le Mabbuleon his radio show withbeatboxerBharadwaj Balaji (also known as Triple B).[9][22]The recording wentviral, receiving over two million views within a week of its release on YouTube. AfterwardsR\u00e9my Martin, an international brand, was surprised by Adhi's determination and launchedHiphop Tamizhaas an official brand.[9]\"Club le Mabbule\" later vaulted Hiphop Tamizha further into public view when it was criticised as portraying Tamil women in a negative light.[23] Hiphop Tamizha's debut albumHip Hop Tamizhanwas released on 17 August 2012 atSathyam Cinemasin Chennai. Publicised as \"India's first Tamil hip hop album\", it was launched by Purple Note and produced by Remy Martin, in the latter's first association with an Indian album. The music was composed by Adhi and Jeeva, with lyrics by Adhi.[18]The album was lauded by critics.Naren Weiss, writing forZomba, called it \"nothing short of a masterpiece\", while Venkatrangan R ofMusicperklabelled it \"A must listen. Not only for the music but for the messages hidden in it.\"[18][non-primary source needed]The album, which includedClub le Mabbule, was also a commercial success, becoming the best-selling music album of 2012 onFlipkart.[24]However, Adhi lamented the fact that \"Club le Mabbule\" was accepted for airplay by radio channels only after its viral success, and that some of his other songs never got airplay even once.[25] In November 2013, Adhi signed an international album with Remy Martin, titledInternational Tamizhan, slated to feature eight tracks, including two songs by American artistsSoland Emcee Call.
