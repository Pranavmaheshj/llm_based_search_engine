Local Processing: No need for OpenAI API keys

Better Context Handling: LLaMAIndex manages large documents effectively

Customizable: Easily switch models (try mistral, phi3, etc.)

Structured Outputs: Tree summarization provides more organized results
The code maintains all the previous benefits (caching, parallel fetching, etc.) while adding the power of local LLM processing through LLaMAIndex.
